This guide will help you quickly provision infrastructure on Kubernetes with Pulumi using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python.

## Before You Begin

If you're new to Pulumi, see the following useful resources:

- [Pulumi Architecture & Concepts](/docs/reference/concepts)
- [Kubernetes with Pulumi](/docs/reference/clouds/kubernetes)

The various SDKs allow Kubernetes users to leverage Pulumi for novel forms of cluster
management, and deployment of app workloads to clusters. Users of
Kubernetes and Pulumi can:

-  Instantiate IaaS resources and managed services from any cloud.
-  Provision managed Kubernetes clusters from the major cloud providers.
-  Provision self-managed (open source) Kubernetes clusters on top of raw IaaS resources or on-prem virtualization providers.
-  Create and orchestrate Kubernetes API resources for app workloads, in the programming language of their choice.
-  Manage real code instead of YAML, JSON, DSL's, or tar archives of templates.
-  Apply standard software development practices to Kubernetes applications, including the use of functions, classes, loops, conditionals, etc.
-  Increase productivity using the power of dev tools such as IDE auto-completion, type &
   error checking, linting, refactoring, and testing frameworks to validate Kubernetes clusters, app workloads, or both.

Let's start with installing Pulumi.

Pulumi's Cloud Native SDK makes it easy to target any Kubernetes environment to
provision a cluster, configure and deploy applications, and update them as
required.

Pulumi supports programming against Kubernetes---Minikube, on-premises and
cloud-hosted custom Kubernetes clusters, and the managed services from Google
(GKE), Azure (AKS), and Amazon (EKS). Pulumi's [Kubernetes provider
package](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-kubernetes) and
[CLI](/docs/reference/commands/) help you accomplish all these within minutes.

This guide will have you quickly provisioning infrastructure on Kubernetes with
Pulumi in your favorite language.

Let's start with installing Pulumi.
